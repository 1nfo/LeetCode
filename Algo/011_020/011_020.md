## 011
head/tail search like sum of two No.
 
## 012
Not efficient, trade-off between space and time.

## 013
generally add one by one, need to determine when to subtract

## 014
avoid to be out of boundaries

## 015
two solution, hashtable or two pointer(head/tail search)
Don't forget to sort first when using pointers

## 016
two pointers;  sort first,

## 017
ret start with [""], and if digits is empty return [] first
C++ solution has runtime err.

## 018
 need  a lot optimization for two-pointers solution:  
 
 1. nums[i]\*4<=target,
 2. nums[i]+nums[j]\*3<=target,
 3. while:l++,r--
